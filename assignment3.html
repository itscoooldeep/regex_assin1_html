            <h1> researchers find a quicker, cheaper way to sort isotopes</h1>

<p>
    BY EMMANUEL ROMEROL.A. Cicero Richard Zare Professor Richard Zare in<br>
    his lab. Whether it's the summer grass that tickles your feet or the <br>
    red Bordeaux smacking on your palate, nearly every part of the world <br>
    around you carries special chemical markers. These markers, called <br>
    isotopes, can tell scientists where the molecules that compose a <br>
    substance are from, where they traveled and what happened to them <br>
    along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex and costly <br>
    Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new method to make isotopic <br>
    analysis easier and less expensive.

            <h1> Chance to dance: Enthusiasts fly to Stanford for dance weekend</h1>

<p>  
BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement-
but life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend 
in Roble Gym offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too, the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco 
hustle, Bollywood and blues fusion.
