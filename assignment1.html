<h2>My Summer adventures</h2>

<h3>My Trip TO California</h3>
<p>It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern California for<br>
    ,the 4th of July weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain.<br>
     By the time we returned home, we had traveled some 1,300 miles in three and one half days.
</p>

<h3>My Trip TO The Rockies</h3>
<p>After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We flew<br> 
    to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Acadamy, Pike's Peak, Garden Of The Gods,<br>
    and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch <br>
    in Northern New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded<br> 
    Amtrack's and rode the rails to Kingman, and then chartered a bus home.
</p>

<h3>My Trip TO The Mid West</h3>
<p>My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles to him in<br> 
    Indiana where he attends college. In route, we stopped at Nauvoo, Illinois, and<br> 
    Detroit, Michigan. We then boarded Amtrak in Chicago, and rode it to Salt Lake City,<br> 
    where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.
